## Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone character interaction

Harry Potter is a fantasy novel series written by J. K. Rowling. The novel dives into the life of a young wizard name Harry Potter and his journey into the world of Magic. The story focuses on Harryâ€™s struggle to defeat Lord Voldemort.[1] The seven novels have also been adapted into eight movies. This aim of this project is to visualize the character interaction in the first book and movie i.e. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Character dialogues were analyzed and their link with other characters was created.
As Harry potter and the philosophers stone is the first movie of the series. It focused on character introduction and interaction to strengthen the bond. Through this visualisation it was observed that Hagrid, who is viewed as a small supporting character has the greatest number of dialogues with Harry. Followed by interaction between Harry, Ron and Hermione, as their friendship is building in this movie. While the antagonist has one of the least dialogues in the movie.

The visualisation was made using glourish and d3.js
